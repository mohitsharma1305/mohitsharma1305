## 🧠 About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science**. I'm a curious learner who blends tech, creativity, and practicality into everything I build. From working on disaster management platforms to exploring UI/UX tools powered by AI — I love creating things that solve real-world problems efficiently.

💡 I’m driven by innovation, efficient systems, and the belief that **technology should serve people** — not the other way around.
